# Code Vein Builder
Code Vein Builder is a tool that lets you create and share builds with others. It was created to help make sharing builds for Code Vein easier. Instead of having to painstakingly write your builds out by hand, you can simply share a link to your build! As an added bonus, the tool's UI closely resembles the in-game UI, which helps make it easier to identify skills, equipment, etc.


### How to Use
Code Vein Builder can be used online or offline. To start creating and sharing builds, choose your preferred method below.

- **Online Version:** https://sethclydesdale.github.io/code-vein-builder/
- **Offline Version:** [download](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/code-vein-builder/archive/master.zip)

#### Using the Offline Version
If you're using the offline version you'll have to unzip the files. Once you've done that, you can access Code Vein Builder by opening any of the index.html files in the browser of your choice. It should have the same experience as the online version, however, if there are any updates, you'll have to download Code Vein Builder from Github again to get the latest version.

#### Keyboard Controls
You can use some keyboard controls while selecting skills/equipment.

- **Left/Right Arrow Keys:** Move left/right in the selection list.
- **Enter Key:** Equip the currently selected skill/equipment.
- **Space Bar:** Cycle through skill/equipment groups.
- **Esc/Escape:** Close the skill/equipment selector without selecting anything.

You can use these shortcuts to undo/redo changes. (you can use the back/forward history buttons, too)
- **ALT+Left Arrow:** Undo Build Change.
- **ALT+Right Arrow:** Redo Build Change.
